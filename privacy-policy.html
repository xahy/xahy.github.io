    <div>
        <p>We do not collect any of your data. The only data collected is collected from within the app itself and only stored
        locally. Prayer times are displayed using the location the user collects.
        </br></br>
        We don't dislay any ads or send anything to any server. So we don't track you using an advertising identifier or
        anything of the sort.
        </br></br>
        Thanks a lot for using Namaadhu Gadi, and we hope you're happy with it. If you have any issues to report or feedback to make
        about this privacy policy or anything else, you can send me an email via m3talloid@gmail.com.</p>
