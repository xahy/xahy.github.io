    <h2>General provisions</h2>
    <div>
        <p>These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted or waived herein, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be
        assigned by us without restriction. In the event that any provision is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, that
        provision will nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and that determination will
        not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions of these terms. The failure of us to
        exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The
        headings used in these terms are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these terms.</p>
